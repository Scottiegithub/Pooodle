# Pooodle

To install, you'll need a browser plugin that can run userscripts.
(GreaseMonkey for Firefox, TamperMonkey for Chrome/Chromium, ViolentMonkey for Opera, etc.)

Then, click on the file "Pooodle.user.js" then click on "Raw". The plugin should ask you whether or not you wish to install the script.
